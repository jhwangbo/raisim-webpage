Ray Test

.. image:: ../image/raytest.gif

Ray test is a collision checker between the world and a ray.
Users specify the starting point, direction and the length and it returns the colliding objects and the distance.
An example is provided `here <https://github.com/raisimTech/raisimLib/blob/master/examples/src/server/rayDemo.cpp>`_
Note that only the following line

.. code-block:: c++

    auto& col = world.rayTest({0,0,5}, direction, 50., true);

performs the ray test. The rest of the code is for demo only.
