**In RaiSim, all material properties are associated with a pair.**
Most physics engines define material properties on each material and average the two material properties to get the contact properties.
The RaiSim way is more accurate and users have more freedom to it but it might be combersome to define a set of material properties for all pairs.

There are currently three material properties used in RaiSim.

* Coefficient of friction (:math:`\mu\ge 0`): This defines how much friction is applied
* Coefficient of restitution (:math:`c_r\ge 0`): How bouncy the material pair is
* Restitution Threshold (:math:`c_{th}\ge 0`): If the impact velocity is smaller than this number, objects do not bounce off

The bounce velocity is computed as :math:`=c_{th}(v_i-c_{th})`

A material name is set when the material is created.
For example,

.. code-block:: C

  auto ball = world->addSphere(1, 1, "steel");

In order to simulate "steel", its material pair has to be added.
Unrecognized material pairs will get **default material properties**  .
