Installation
#############################

Setup
========

Please install/save everything locally to prevent any conflicts with other libraries. We will assume that you have a single workspace where you save all repos related to raisim. Here we introduce two variables

* WORKSPACE: workspace where you clone your git repos (e.g., ~/raisim_workspace)
* LOCAL_BUILD: build directory where you install exported cmake libraries (e.g., ~/raisim_build)

Dependencies
============

raisim depends on the two open-source libraries

* Eigen3 (:code:`sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev`)
* png (included in raisim. Automatically installed if you install raisim)

RaiSim
========

Installing RaiSim is trivial. You can just copy paste lib and include to $LOCAL_BUILD, or you can use cmake. 
Assuming that you have cloned this repo,

.. code-block:: bash

  cd $WORKSPACE/raisimLib
  mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$LOCAL_BUILD && make install
