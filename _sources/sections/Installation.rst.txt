Installation
#############################

Setup
========

Please install/save everything locally to prevent any conflicts with other libraries. We will assume that you have a single workspace where you save all repos related to raisim. Here we introduce two variables

* WORKSPACE: workspace where you clone your git repos (e.g., ~/raisim_workspace)
* LOCAL_BUILD: build directory where you install exported cmake libraries (e.g., ~/raisim_build)

Dependencies
============

RaiSim depends on the following open-source libraries

* *Eigen3* (:code:`sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev`)

RaiSim does not contain Eigen operations in the binaries. 
All Eigen operations stay in the header files.
Therefore, there is much less risk of version incompatibility (zero risk unless Eigen team removes a method that is used in the RaiSim header files).

RaiSim includes the following open-source libraries (You do not have to install them yourself): 
*TinyXML*, *Open Dynamics Engine*

RaiSim
========

We provide the following two installation options

Option 1
***********
Copy-paste the lib and the include directories to $LOCAL_BUILD.

Option 2
***********
Assuming that you have cloned raisimLib repo,

.. code-block:: bash

  cd $WORKSPACE/raisimLib
  mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$LOCAL_BUILD && make install
