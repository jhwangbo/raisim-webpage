Installation

Setup
========

Please install/save everything locally to prevent any conflicts with other libraries. We will assume that you have a single workspace where you save all repos related to raisim. Here we introduce two variables

* ``WORKSPACE``: workspace where you clone your git repos (e.g., ~/raisim_workspace)
* ``LOCAL_INSTALL``: build directory where you install exported cmake libraries (e.g., ~/raisim_build)

Dependencies
============

RaiSim depends on the following open-source libraries

* *Eigen3* (:code:`sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev`)
* cmake > 3.10 (Technically it is not a dependency but it makes the installation easier)

RaiSim includes the following open-source libraries (You do not have to install them yourself): 
*TinyXML*, *Open Dynamics Engine*

RaiSim Install
===============

RaiSim is installed using cmake. The following options are available

* ``RAISIM_EXAMPLE`` : Compile C++ RaiSim examples
* ``RAISIM_MATLAB`` : Compile raisimMatlab (compiled binary is also provided). You need MATLAB for this option
* ``RAISIM_PY`` : Compile raisimPy. The python version can be set as ``-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=$LOCATION_OF_THE_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE``
* ``RAISIM_DOC`` : This is for developers only. The documentation is available at raisim.com

Example install in Linux

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $WORKSPACE/raisimLib
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$LOCAL_INSTALL -DRAISIM_EXAMPLE=ON -DRAISIM_PY=ON
    make install -j4

To use RaiSimUnity in Linux, you need to install ``minizip``, ``ffmpeg`` and ``vulkan`` (``sudo apt install minizip ffmpeg``).

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install libvulkan1 mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-utils
    sudo apt install minizip ffmpeg
