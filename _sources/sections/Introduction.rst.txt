Introduction

RaiSim is a physics engine developed by RaiSim Tech Inc.
It is designed to provide both the accuracy and speed for simulating robotic systems.
However, it is a generic rigid-body simulator and can simulate any rigid body very efficiently.

**Why RaiSim?**

* The speed is benchmarked against other popular physics engine. (`[1] <https://github.com/leggedrobotics/SimBenchmark>`_)
* The accuracy of RaiSim has been demonstrated in a number of papers (`[2] <https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/4/26/eaau5872/tab-article-info>`_, `[3] <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07517.pdf>`_, `[4] <https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/5/47/eabc5986>`_,  `[5] <https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08399>`_,  `[6] <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08811>`_)
* Easiest C++ simulation library to learn/use
* A minimum number of dependencies (only on STL and Eigen)

Visualizer
=====================
There are two options available for visualization.
Most of the examples included in this repo requires raisimUnity to visualize.
You have to run raisimUnity before running the examples.



raisimUnity
***************
.. image:: ../image/raisimUnity.png
  :alt: raisimUnity
  :width: 600

* **If this doesn't work on your linux machine, try raisimUnityOpengl, which is a stripped-down version**
* binaries included in the ``raisimUnity`` directory
* easy to use but less features
* runs as a separate process
* works well in Linux, Mac and Windows
* source code available `here <https://github.com/raisimTech/raisimUnity>`_ under the MIT license. Written in C#


raisimOgre
************

.. image:: ../image/raisimOgre.png
  :alt: raisimOgre
  :width: 420

* harder to use but rich in features
* works well in Linux. Should work in other two major OS's but not tested
* easy to customize. Only C++ code
* source code available `here <https://github.com/raisimTech/raisimogre>`_ under the MIT license


System Requirements
=====================
- **Linux**

    * We recommend ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04 but RaiSim might work on other distributions

- **Windows 10**

    * Visual Studio 2019

- **Mac**

    * Latest version. (But probably work on most versions if the cpu supports AVX2)

Example code
===================
Here is an example of an RaiSim application code.

.. code-block:: c

  #include “raisim/World.hpp”
  #include "raisim/RaisimServer.hpp"

  int main() {
    raisim::World::setActivationKey("PATH_TO_THE_ACTIVATION_KEY");
    raisim::World world;
    auto anymal = world.addArticulatedSystem(PATH_TO_URDF);
    auto ball = world.addSphere(1, 1);
    auto ground = world.addGround();
    world.setTimeStep(0.002);

    /// launch raisim server for visualization. Can be visualized on raisimUnity
    raisim::RaisimServer server(&world);
    server.launchServer();

    while (1) {
      raisim::MSLEEP(2);
      server.integrateWorldThreadSafe();
    }

    server.killServer();
  }

Here is a cmake file to compile above application code.

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
  project(raisim_examples LANGUAGES CXX)

  find_package(raisim CONFIG REQUIRED)
  find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
  
  include_directories (${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS})

  add_executable(APP_NAME ${file_name})
  target_link_libraries(APP_NAME PUBLIC raisim::raisim pthread)
  target_include_directories(APP_NAME PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

A working version can be found here (RAISIM_EXAMPLE_).
