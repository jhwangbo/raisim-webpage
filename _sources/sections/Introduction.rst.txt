Introduction

RaiSim is a physics engine developed by RaiSim Tech Inc.
It is designed to provide both the accuracy and speed for simulating robotic systems.
However, it is a generic rigid-body simulator and can simulate any rigid body very efficiently.

Here is a list of advantages of using RaiSim:

* The speed is benchmarked against other popular physics engine. (`[1] <https://github.com/leggedrobotics/SimBenchmark>`_)
* The accuracy of RaiSim has been demonstrated in a number of papers (`[2] <https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/4/26/eaau5872/tab-article-info>`_, `[3] <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07517.pdf>`_)
* Easiest C++ simulation library to learn/use
* A minimum number of dependencies (only on STL and Eigen)

System Requirements
=====================

- **Linux**

    * We recommend ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04 but RaiSim might work on other distributions

    * The binaries contain AVX2 instructions. If your CPU is 7-year-old or older (before Haswell), it is likely that raisim does not work on your machine.

- **Windows 10**

    * Visual Studio 2019

- **Mac**

    * The binaries also contain AVX2 instructions.

Example code
===================
Here is an example of an RaiSim application code.

.. code-block:: c

  #include “raisim/World.hpp”
  #include "raisim/RaisimServer.hpp"

  int main() {
    raisim::World world;
    auto anymal = world.addArticulatedSystem(PATH_TO_URDF);
    auto ball = world.addSphere(1, 1);
    auto ground = world.addGround();
    world.setTimeStep(0.002);

    /// launch raisim server for visualization. Can be visualized on raisimUnity
    raisim::RaisimServer server(&world);
    server.launchServer();

    while (1) {
      raisim::MSLEEP(2);
      server.integrateWorldThreadSafe();
    }

    server.killServer();
  }

Here is a cmake file to compile above application code.

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
  project(raisim_examples LANGUAGES CXX)

  find_package(raisim CONFIG REQUIRED)
  find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
  
  include_directories (${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS})

  add_executable(APP_NAME ${file_name})
  target_link_libraries(APP_NAME PUBLIC raisim::raisim pthread)
  target_include_directories(APP_NAME PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

A working version can be found here (RAISIM_EXAMPLE_).

Included Software
======================

raisimUnity
---------------
A visualizer for RaiSim.
An executable is provided so no need to install anything.
raisimOgre is not a recommended visualizer anymore because it is very tricky to make it work for both MATLAB and Python.

raisimPy
---------------
A python wrapper for RaiSim. It was initially developed by Delhaisse, Brian and Rozo, Leonel (https://github.com/robotlearn/raisimpy)

raisimMatlab
---------------
A MATLAB wrapper for RaiSim. It is currently minimalistic. We also provide the source so that you can add a method that you need in the cpp file.
