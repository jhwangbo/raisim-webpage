Introduction

RaiSim is a physics engine developed by the researchers at Robotic Systems Lab, ETH Zurich.
It was designed to provide both the accuracy and speed for simulating robotic systems. 
However, it is a generic rigid-body simulator and can simulate any rigid body efficiently.

Here is a list of advantages of using RaiSim:

* The speed is benchmarked against other popular physics engine. (`[1] <https://github.com/leggedrobotics/SimBenchmark>`_)
* The accuracy of RaiSim has been demonstrated through a number of papers (`[2] <https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/4/26/eaau5872/tab-article-info>`_, `[3] <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07517.pdf>`_)
* Easiest C++ simulation library to learn/use (see)
* A minimum number of dependencies (only on STL, Eigen)

System Requirements
=====================

RaiSim is supported only on the following systems
* Linux only. support ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 but might work on other distributions
* g++, gcc > 6 (how to install?)
* cmake > 3.10 (how to install?)
* The binaries contain avx2 instructions. If your CPU is 6-year-old or older (before Haswell), it is likely that raisimLib does not work on your machine.
