The current public ``raisim2Lib`` workspace does not ship a MATLAB wrapper
source directory or CMake target. ``RAISIM_MATLAB`` remains declared as a
compatibility/reserved CMake option, but enabling it does not build a wrapper.

Use the C++ API directly or :doc:`RaiSimPy` for a currently maintained language
binding. Do not rely on ``RAISIM_MATLAB=ON`` as an installation step.
