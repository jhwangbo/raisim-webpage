Kinematics
===============

We represent a position vector in a Cartesian coordinate as :math:`^Wr`, where :math:`^W` is the frame in which the vector is expressed.
In this document, :math:`W` represents the **world frame** which is an inertial frame (zero acceleration).
Unless otherwise stated explicitly, all vector quanties in RaiSim are expressed in the world frame.

A position vector can be expressed in any frame. To express the vector in a different frame, we use a linear transformation as shown below

.. math::

  \begin{eqnarray}
    ^Br&= {}^{BW\!}R ^Wr,\\
    ^Wr&= {}^{WB\!}R ^Br.
  \end{eqnarray}

In this document, symbol :math:`^B` represents the **body frame**, which is assigned to every bodies in RaiSim. 
:math:`^{WB}R` is called **body rotation matrix**. 
**Note that the body rotation matrix maps a vector expressed in the body frame to a vector expressed in the world frame**
