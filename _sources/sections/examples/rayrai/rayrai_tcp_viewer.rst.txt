Rayrai Example: TCP Viewer
##########################

Overview
========
Standalone TCP viewer for RaisimServer scenes. It connects to a running server, downloads the remote scene, and renders it with rayrai and ImGui controls. Use this as the reference for the TCP viewer workflow, resource discovery, and sensor update handling.

Binary
======
CMake target and executable name: ``rayrai_tcp_viewer``.

Run
====
Build and run from your build directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake --build . --target rayrai_tcp_viewer
   ./rayrai_tcp_viewer

On Windows, run ``rayrai_tcp_viewer.exe`` instead.
This example uses the in-process rayrai renderer (no external client required).


Details
=======
- Connects to a running RaisimServer over TCP and downloads the remote scene.
- Renders the streamed scene with rayrai and exposes an ImGui control panel.
- Handles VISUALIZER sensor updates (RGB/depth) from the server.
