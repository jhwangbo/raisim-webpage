Server Example: Minitaur PD
###########################

Overview
========
Runs Minitaur with PD control, including per-joint gains that zero out unactuated joints. It is a compact reference for legged robot PD setup.

Screenshot

Binary
======
CMake target and executable name: ``minitaur_pd``.

Run
====
Build and run from your build directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake --build . --target minitaur_pd
   ./minitaur_pd

On Windows, run ``minitaur_pd.exe`` instead.
This example uses RaisimServer. Start a visualizer client (RaisimUnity, RaisimUnreal, or the rayrai TCP viewer) and connect to port 8080.


Details
=======
- Loads the Minitaur URDF (closed-loop) and applies PD to actuated joints.
- Sets gains to zero for unactuated joints in the closed-loop model.
- Focuses the camera on the robot to show posture stability.
