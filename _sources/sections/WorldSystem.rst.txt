RaiSim World
#############################

raisim::World class creates/manages all resources. 
It is the only class that you have to create yourself, except a few math classes and materials.
All objects defined in the same Wolrd class instance can collide each other unless their collision mask and group explicitly disables the collision. 

Currently, you can only dynamically generate the world. We are working on a method of generating a world from an XML script.
