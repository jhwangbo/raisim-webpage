:code:`raisim::Object` (and thus :code:`raisim::ArticulatedSystem` and :code:`raisim:SingleBodyObject`) have a method :code:`getPerObjectContact` which returns the list of contacts.
Most useful information for users are stored in the member :code:`contacts_` (of type :code:`std::vector<Contact>`), which can be obtained by :code:`getContacts()`.
For example,

.. code-block:: c

  anymal->getPerObjectContact()->getContacts();

Contact class is header-only and can be found at :code:`include/raisim/contact/Contact.hpp`.

Note that all vector quantities are expressed in the respective **Contact Frame**.
A contact frame is defined such that its z-axis is aligned with the contact normal and its origin is at the contact point. 
Its x- and y-axes are arbitrary chosen.
