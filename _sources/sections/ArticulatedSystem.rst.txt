State Representation
=============================
here is :math:`^j_k\boldsymbol{q}=mc^2 \in \mathbb{R}`

.. math::

   \begin{eqnarray}
      y    & = & ax^2 + bx + c \\
      f(x) & = & x^2 + 2xy + y^2
   \end{eqnarray}

Types of Indicies
=============================

ArticulatedSystem class contains multiple types of indicies. To query a specific quantity, you have to provide an index of the right type. Here are the types of indicies in Articulated Systems

* Body/Joint Index: All fixed bodies are combined to a single movable body. Each movable body has a unique body index. Because there is a movable joint associated with a movable body, there is a 1-to-1 mapping between the joints and the bodies and they share the same index. For a fixed-base system, the first body rigidly fixed to the world is body-0. For a floating-base system, the floating base is body-0.
* Generalized Velocity (DOF) Index: All joints are mapped to a specific set of generalized velocity indicies.
* Generalized Coordinate Index:
* Frame Index:
