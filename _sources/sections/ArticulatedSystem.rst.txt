Articulated Systems
#############################

Articulated Systems are a system of multiple bodies connected by joints. 
There are two types of articulated systems: *Kinematic trees* and *closed-loop systems*. 
Kinematic trees do not contain a loop (a body always has a single joint).
Consequently, the number of joints is equal to the number of bodies (for floating systems, we assign a floating joint on the root body).
RaiSim can only simulate **kinematic trees**.

Each body has a set of collision bodies and visual objects. 
Collision bodies contain a collision object
Visual objects just store specifications for visualization and the actual visualzation happens in a visualizer (e.g., `raisimOgre <https://github.com/leggedrobotics/raisimOgre>`_)


State Representation
=============================

The state of an articulated system can be represented by a **generalized state** :math:`\boldsymbol{S}`, which is composed of a **generalized coordinate** :math:`\boldsymbol{q}` and a **generalized velocity** :math:`\boldsymbol{u}`.
Since we are not constraining their parameterization, in general, 

.. math::

  \begin{equation}
    u\neq\dot{q}.
  \end{equation}

A generalized coordinate fully represents the configuration of the articulated system and a generalized velocity fully represents the velocity state of the articulated system.

Kinematics

Dynamics
=============================

All force and torque acting on the system can be represented as a single vector in the generalized velocity space.
This representation is called **generalized force** :math:`\boldsymbol{\tau}`.
Just like in a Cartesian coordiate (i.e., x, y, z axes), the power exerted by an articulated system is computed as a dot product of generalized force and generalized velocity (i.e., :math:`\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau}`).

We can also combine the mass and inertia of the whole articulated system and represent them in a single matrix.
This matrix is called **mass matrix** or **inertia matrix** and denoted as :math:`\boldsymbol{M}`. 
A mass matrix represents how much the articulated system resists change in generalized velocities.
Naively speaking, a large mass matrix means that the articulated system gets low velocity change for a given generalized force.

The total kinetic energy of the system is computed as :math:`\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{u}^TM\boldsymbol{u}`.

The equation of motion of an articulated system is shown below:

.. math::

  \begin{equation}
     \boldsymbol{\tau} = \boldsymbol{M}(\boldsymbol{q})\dot{\boldsymbol{u}} + \boldsymbol{h}(\boldsymbol{q}, \boldsymbol{u}).
  \end{equation}

Here :math:`\boldsymbol{h}` is called a non-linear term. 
There are two sources of force that contributes to the non-linear: gravity and

Types of Indicies
=============================

ArticulatedSystem class contains multiple types of indicies. To query a specific quantity, you have to provide an index of the right type. Here are the types of indicies in Articulated Systems

* **Body/Joint Index**: All fixed bodies are combined to a single movable body. Each movable body has a unique body index. Because there is a movable joint associated with a movable body, there is a 1-to-1 mapping between the joints and the bodies and they share the same index. For a fixed-base system, the first body rigidly fixed to the world is body-0. For a floating-base system, the floating base is body-0.
* **Generalized Velocity (DOF) Index**: All joints are mapped to a specific set of generalized velocity indicies.
* **Generalized Coordinate Index**:
* **Frame Index**:
